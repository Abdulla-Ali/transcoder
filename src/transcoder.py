    """This function is called when this file is executed as a
program. Usually we don't bother putting a docstring in this function,
but I decided to add this one as a simple example. 

Notice that the String is 'triple quoted'. Usually, a String in Python
is bounded by one single or double quote mark. 'Like this' "or like
this". You can also use triples like this one does. It has a few
benefits that sometimes come in handy. In particular, you can easily
include single and double quote characters within it, because it takes
three in a row to signal the end. You can also go across multiple
lines, like I have here.
